I've been a dad for 3 days, 20 hours, 45 minutes and 43 seconds. It certainly doesn't take long to start seeing patterns however. The first pattern I have noticed is I'm constantly being asked for/todo things (Could you hand me X). I have spent 70% of my time helping my wife out and the other 30% of the time feeling guilty that I can't help her more than I do.

Spending 30% of my time feeling guilty wasn't going to cut it for me so in my sleep deprived state I decided to set out on a journey to help my wife in creative ways. Prior to child birth (PCB - not the spring break one) I spent nearly all my time building gadgets and playing with open source software so that seemed like the first logical place to start. This blog will serve as the journal to my numerous attempts to build devices and software that will hopefully help my wife with that other 30%.
